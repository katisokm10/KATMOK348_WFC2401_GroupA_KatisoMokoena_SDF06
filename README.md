CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile

In this project, I recreated a simplified version of my Codespace Pets Instagram profile page focusing on CSS layout and styling. This involved applying various CSS techniques to achieve a responsive, aesthetically pleasing design that functions well across different devices. This CSS code provides styling for a web page with a profile section and a gallery section. It is designed to be responsive and features various components like buttons, user profile information, and a gallery display.

Project Structure
Global Styles: Defines basic styling for the entire page, such as font family, background color, and color palette.

Profile Section: Styles for the user profile section, including the profile image, user settings, statistics, and biography.

Gallery Section: Styles for a responsive gallery with individual items that display additional information on hover or focus.

Loader: Animation style for a loader, typically used for indicating content loading.

Media Query: Adjustments for smaller screens using a media query, optimizing the layout for better usability on mobile devices.

Challenges Faced
Cross-Browser Compatibility:
Ensuring consistent styling across various browsers posed a challenge due to differences in rendering engines. We addressed this by testing and applying specific vendor prefixes when necessary.

Responsive Design Complexity:
Achieving a seamless responsive design for different screen sizes and devices was challenging. We iteratively adjusted the layout and styling to ensure optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Gallery Item Interaction:
Implementing the interactive behavior of gallery items, especially on hover and focus, required a balance between aesthetics and usability. Fine-tuning the transitions and ensuring accessibility was a priority.
